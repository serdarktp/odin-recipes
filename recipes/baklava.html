    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This is simple and easy. Serve it in cupcake papers. It freezes well, too.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 pound chopped nuts</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package phyllo dough</li>
        <li>1 cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>Â½ cup honey</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon grated lemon zest</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
            Butter a 9x13 inch baking dish.
        </li>
        <li>
            Toss together cinnamon and nuts. Unroll phyllo 
            and cut whole stack in half to fit the dish. 
            Cover phyllo with a damp cloth while assembling 
            the baklava, to keep it from drying out.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place two sheets of phyllo in the bottom of the 
            prepared dish. Brush generously with butter. 
            Sprinkle 2 to 3 tablespoons of the nut mixture 
            on top. Repeat layers until all ingredients are 
            used, ending with about 6 sheets of phyllo. 
            Using a sharp knife, cut baklava (all the way 
            through to the bottom of the dish) into four 
            long rows, then (nine times) diagonally to make 
            36 diamond shapes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in preheated oven until golden brown and crisp, about 50 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            While baklava is baking, combine sugar and water in 
            a small saucepan over medium heat and bring to a boil.
            Stir in honey, vanilla and lemon or orange zest; 
            reduce heat and simmer 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove the baklava from the oven and immediately spoon 
            the syrup over it. Let cool completely before serving. 
            Store uncovered.
        </li>
    </ol>
